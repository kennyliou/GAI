Kenny: 
Looking into color differences
the formula we are going to use is called CIE94
However, CIE94 is cased on Lab model, need to write a converter first to convert RGB to Lab
Then use LAB to do CIE94 calculation

Kenny:
Finish color difference. Now we have a function COlorDifference.findDifference(rgb1, rgb2) to find the color difference.
The value can be from 0 to 255 (also 0.5 and so on).
Right now we highlight any difference that's greater than 30. We still need to find a better value (maybe the value change when dealing different color?)
